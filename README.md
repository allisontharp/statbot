# statbot

/u/stat-bot is a reddit bot that displays statistics on recorded plays.  It monitors /r/statbot for comments in the following format:

*/u/stat-bot username plays startdate enddate*

Where username is your **boardgamegeek username** and **start and end date** make the date range to look at.  If end date is empty, it goes until the current day.  If both start and end date are empty, it returns stats for all plays.




Future Development:
- More interesting statistics
- Statistics on collections
- Historical play stats
